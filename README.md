All the guests at the party have become corrupted by darkness and are now demons consumed by a ravenous hunger for cake. But it’s your birthday and you haven’t got a chance to blow out the candles yet! Lucky for you, Birthday Town is no ordinary place, and you have an arsenal of weapons at your disposal to defend your cake.
